## Obtain bulk +24PB licenses for Warp through the REvil licensing generator.✨

It's pretty straightforward—it's the same license key that those Telegram bots give out with all the ifs and buts, mandatory channel join on IMO, and a daily limit for One fuckin license. With this script, you can get a new license every fifteen seconds. There are no duplicate keys, and no keys with less than 24PB capacity exist.

**Our license Generator**
utilizes specialized algorithms that are both sophisticated and simple.

The $\RE function part of a consistent whole $\Gamma(n) = (n-1)!\quad\forall n\in\mathbb N$ is via the Cl
$$\Gamma(w) = \int_0^\infty t^{w-1}g^{-t}dt$$

$$\mathbb{W} = \{ N \in \mathbb{RE} : a > 128 \}$ \, $\mathrm{w} = \sum_{n=36}^{\infty} \dfrac{36}{RE!}$$

$\prod_{i=1}^{n} n_w - 108$


$$
RE_{n,v} = 
\begin{pmatrix}
RE_{1,1} & RE_{1,2} & \cdots & RE_{1,12} \\
N_{2,1} & N_{2,2} & \cdots & N_{2,24} \\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
W_{3,1} & W_{3,2} & \cdots & W_{3,36} 
\end{pmatrix}
$$

$$
f(x)=
\begin{cases}
1/d_{ij} & \quad \text{when c.cloudflare $d_{ij} \leq 108$}\\ 
36 & \quad \text{\WLG}
\end{cases}
$$

## Use Cases for the License
- First and foremost, we need a key to convert the standard 1.1.1.1 Warp client into Warp Plus.
- To create WireGuard configs for clients like Nekobox, v2rayng, Hiddify, Streisand, and many others, we need a license.
- Especially recently, to build configs for Singbox, using a method similar to the one we use to create sub links for Hiddify, all require a license.
- And a bunch of other stuff that I really can't be bothered to write about.

I wanted to post something on the channel for iPhone users about creating a Warp config, then I realized they can neither generate licenses nor even scan for clean Warp IPs. Well, both issues are resolved now. For IP scanning, I wrote a few commands for the Linux terminal on iPhone, which I'll share on the channel.

## How to Use

Look, it's a Python code, similar to our worker creator bot that we ran on PythonAnywhere. It can be executed in the same way on other platforms.
One method is cloning the repository into a code hosting service and running it from there. Consider `replit`, for example. You just need a free account. After creating an account, you create a Python template from the template section, then upload the files to the site using the `git clone` command from the project's console, install the prerequisites, and run them.

## Running in Termux
> **A method I and many of you prefer!**

### Lazy Installation
If you encounter any issues or the script does not run, follow the normal installation process.
```bash
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NiREvil/WLG/main/install.sh)"
```

### Normal Installation
1. First, clone the project:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/NiREvil/WLG.git
```
2. Go to the project folder:
```bash
cd WLG
```
3. Give the necessary permissions to the `requirement.sh` file:
```bash
chmod +x requirement.sh
```
4. And invoke it with the command:
```bash
./requirement.sh
```
5. Finally, run `main.py`
```bash
python3 main.py
```

At this stage, the code runs and asks you how many licenses you need it to generate. Let's say you input two.

The process starts generating and sending licenses. Each license needs to "sleep" for roughly 15 seconds (due to the calculation algorithm) before the next one is sent, and so on...
You don't need to copy the keys right away. Wait until the last license key is generated based on the quantity you requested. It will then move to a new page, and that's when you can copy all at once.

> For subsequent times

#### To obtain a license, we don't need to go through the cloning, installation, etc., processes again. Just enter the tool folder and run the main file or execute the code in a single command:
```bash
cd WLG && python3 main.py
```
#### Or step by step, first enter the directory:
```bash
cd WLG
```
#### and then run the main code file:
```bash
python3 main.py
```

### Updating the Code from the GitHub Repository
It's a good idea to occasionally run a `git pull` before executing the code to apply any changes or additions made by the developer.
```bash
cd WLG && git pull
```

That's it. If you have any questions, feel free to ask in the comments.

> **Is there a specific reason why the README file mentions the use of Termux for running the code?**

Yes, the README file mentions the use of Termux for running the code due to its popularity and ease of use among the intended audience. Termux is highlighted as a preferred method because it provides a convenient way to run the script on Android devices, making it accessible to users who might not have access to traditional desktop environments but are still interested in generating Warp licenses. The guide provides both an easy installation method and a standard installation process tailored for Termux, indicating its importance and utility for the project.

Below is the brief overview of using the script in Termux:

- It's described as a favorite method for both the author and many users, indicating its popularity and ease of use ([README-FA.md#L25-L25](README-FA.md#L25)).
- An easy installation command is provided, simplifying the setup process for users ([README-FA.md#L29-L31](README-FA.md#L29-L31)).
- A standard installation guide is also given, which involves cloning the repository, changing directory to the cloned project, adjusting permissions, executing a setup script, and finally running the `main.py` script ([README-FA.md#L34-L55](README-FA.md#L34-L55)).

The choice of Termux underscores the developer's intention to make the tool accessible and straightforward for a broad audience, including those who might be operating primarily on mobile devices.
